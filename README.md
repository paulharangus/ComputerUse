## Quickstart: running the Docker container

### Vertex

You'll need to pass in Google Cloud credentials with appropriate permissions to use Claude on Vertex.

```bash
docker build . -t computer-use-demo
gcloud auth application-default login
export VERTEX_REGION=%your_vertex_region%
export VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=%your_vertex_project_id%
docker run \
    -e API_PROVIDER=vertex \
    -e CLOUD_ML_REGION=$VERTEX_REGION \
    -e ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=$VERTEX_PROJECT_ID \
    -v $HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json:/home/computeruse/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json \
    -p 5900:5900 \
    -p 8501:8501 \
    -p 6080:6080 \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -it computer-use-demo
```

Once the container is running, see the [Accessing the demo app](#accessing-the-demo-app) section below for instructions on how to connect to the interface.

This example shows how to use the Google Cloud Application Default Credentials to authenticate with Vertex.

You can also set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to use an arbitrary credential file, see the [Google Cloud Authentication documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#GAC) for more details.

### Accessing the demo app

Once the container is running, open your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the combined interface that includes both the agent chat and desktop view.

The container stores settings like the API key and custom system prompt in `~/.anthropic/`. Mount this directory to persist these settings between container runs.

Alternative access points:

- Streamlit interface only: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
- Desktop view only: [http://localhost:6080/vnc.html](http://localhost:6080/vnc.html)
- Direct VNC connection: `vnc://localhost:5900` (for VNC clients)
